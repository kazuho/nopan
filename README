DESCRIPTION
    Nopan downloads software from a subversion repository or a git
    repository using HTTP, and automatically installs the software.

    Nopan currently supports following types of software repositories.

    autotools-based repositories
        repositories with `configure' script or `configure.(ac|in)' are
        considered as autotools-based repositories and are installed using:
        ./configure && make all && make install. If only `configure.(ac|in)'
        exists, autoreconf -i will be run prior to generate `configure'.

    perl repositories
        repositories that have Makefile.PL are considered as perl module
        repositories and are installed using: perl Makefile.PL && make all
        test && make install.

    Makefile-only repositories
        if the repository does not match either of the rules above, but has
        a `Makefile', nopan will try to install the repository by running:
        make all && sudo make install.
